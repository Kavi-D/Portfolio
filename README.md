# My Portfolio web application
Single page application displaying my current works and bio

## What I will be using
- main language will be javascript with react as the framework
- Nextjs will be used for single page routing and appropriate SSR design
- Chose chakra UI for font, design/styling and three.js to learn simple animations
- Want to keep the design simple and readable, might have to use google api for font styling 

## Deploying the project
- this portion of the project is unkown, need to look into it further
- some ideas for this portfolio include heroku, Github Pages, Google Cloud Hosting...
