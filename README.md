# My Portfolio web application
Single page application displaying my current works and bio

## What I used (Frameworks and Libraries)
- main language will be javascript with react as the framework
- Nextjs will be used for single page routing and appropriate SSR design
- Chose chakra UI for font, design/styling and three.js to learn simple animations
- Want to keep the design simple and readable, might have to use google api for font styling 

## Deploying the project
- Current deployment of the website is done via Vercel mainly due to cost and no other options for proper free hosting
