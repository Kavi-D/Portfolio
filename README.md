# Portfolio
Single page application displaying my current works and bio

## What I will be using
- main language will be javascript with react as the framework
- Nextjs will be used for single page routing and appropriate SSR design
- Thinking of using either chakra or material ui for design and animations
- Want to keep the design simple and readable, might have to use google api for font styling


## Deploying the project
- this portion of the project is unkown, need to look into it further
