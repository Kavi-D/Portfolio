# My Portfolio web application
Single page application displaying my current works and bio

## What I used (Frameworks and Libraries)
- main language will be javascript with react as the framework
- Nextjs will be used for single page routing and appropriate SSR design
- Chose chakra UI for font, design/styling and three.js to learn simple animations
- Want to keep the design simple and readable to just display my projects and socials

## Deploying the project
- Current deployment of the website is done via Vercel mainly due to cost and no other options for proper free hosting
- The url for this website is temporary, but provides a way to access the site: https://portfolio-tau-liard-99.vercel.app/
